# UN-SDG-Data-Viz

The United Nations has a list of  17 Sustainable evelopment goals, each comprising a set of indicators. UN describes these goals as the blueprint for a more resilient and prosperous world and the roadmap out of current global crises

This repository contains a Tableau Story that vizualizes the progress of a selected number of the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. Creating metrics and evaluating them are a key process for finding areas of improvement for said goals. 

The data was obtained from the United Nations Statistics database:

https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/database

From the database I extraced an excel file that contained development goal data for a specifc indicator for each region/country. I filtered each file to remove indidivual country data and only have region data to reduce the total amount of data and then I filtered out any other unnecessary data that may clutter the visualizations.

In future iterations I plan to create more visualization for additional indicators and include target goal data for the SDG.
